Good. Moving to **Chapter 3 – IoT Hardware & Software**, starting with the first topic only:

# **Topic 3.1 – Sensors and Actuators**

This is a scoring topic. Questions come in the form of:

* “What are sensors?”
* “Types of sensors in IoT.”
* “Define actuators with examples.”
* “Differentiate sensors and actuators.”

Let’s break it down with clarity.

---

# **1. Sensors**

A **sensor** is a device that detects physical changes in the environment and converts them into electrical or digital signals.

In simple terms:
**Sensors sense.**

They collect data such as:

* temperature
* light
* sound
* pressure
* humidity
* motion

### **Why sensors matter in IoT:**

IoT is useless without data.
Sensors provide that raw, real-world input.

---

# **2. Types of Sensors (Most common in IoT)**

You don’t need a huge list. These core sensor types will cover exam expectations.

---

### **1. Temperature Sensor**

Measures heat/temperature.
Examples: **LM35, DS18B20, DHT11 (also humidity).**

---

### **2. Humidity Sensor**

Measures moisture in air.
Example: **DHT11 / DHT22.**

---

### **3. Ultrasonic Sensor**

Measures distance using sound waves.
Example: **HC-SR04.**

Used in robots, parking systems, obstacle detection.

---

### **4. Motion Sensor**

Detects movement of objects or people.
Example: **PIR sensor.**

Used in security systems and automation.

---

### **5. Light Sensor**

Measures light intensity.
Example: **LDR.**

Used in automatic street lights, smart lamps.

---

### **6. Gas/Smoke Sensor**

Detects gas leaks or air quality.
Example: **MQ series (MQ-2, MQ-5).**

---

### **7. Pressure Sensor**

Measures air or water pressure.
Example: **BMP180.**

---

### **8. Proximity Sensor**

Detects object presence without physical contact.
Used in mobiles, cars, robotics.

---

# **3. Actuators**

An **actuator** is a device that performs physical action when it receives a signal.

In simple terms:
**Sensors collect data; Actuators act on that data.**

They convert electrical signals → physical movement or output.

---

# **4. Types of Actuators (Important ones)**

### **1. DC Motor**

Provides rotational motion.
Used in fans, wheels of robots.

---

### **2. Servo Motor**

Provides controlled angular movement (0° to 180°).
Used in robotic arms, camera gimbals.

---

### **3. Stepper Motor**

Moves in precise steps.
Used in 3D printers, CNC machines.

---

### **4. Relay**

Acts like an electrical switch.
Used to turn AC appliances ON/OFF.

---

### **5. Solenoid**

Provides push/pull linear motion.
Used in door locks, vending machines.

---

### **6. Buzzer**

Produces sound.
Used in alerts and alarms.

# **5. Difference Between Sensors and Actuators (Exam Table)**

| **Sensors**                           | **Actuators**                          |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Detect physical changes               | Perform physical actions               |
| Input devices                         | Output devices                         |
| Convert physical → electrical signals | Convert electrical → mechanical action |
| Example: Temperature sensor           | Example: Motor, relay                  |

A short table like this fetches full marks.

# **6. Exam-Ready Short Note**

If asked:

**“Write a note on sensors and actuators.”**

Your answer should hit these points:

* Sensors: definition + 4–5 examples
* Actuators: definition + 3–4 examples
* One-line comparison table

That’s the perfect exam response.
