Alright, moving to **Topic 3.2 – IoT Hardware Platforms (Arduino & Raspberry Pi)**.
This is one of the easiest scoring topics if you understand the differences clearly.

# **Topic 3.2 – IoT Hardware Platforms**

Two major platforms dominate IoT development in education and entry-level projects:

1. **Arduino (Microcontroller-based)**
2. **Raspberry Pi (Microprocessor-based)**

Most exam questions ask:

* “Explain Arduino.”
* “Explain Raspberry Pi.”
* “Differentiate Arduino and Raspberry Pi.”
* “Explain IoT hardware platforms.”

Let’s break it down cleanly.

# **1. Arduino**

Arduino is an **open-source microcontroller platform** used for sensing and controlling devices.

### **Key points you MUST write:**

* Arduino boards use microcontrollers (ATmega328, ATmega2560, etc.)
* Used for reading sensors and controlling actuators
* Programmed using Arduino IDE (C/C++ based)
* Low power, cheap, simple
* Ideal for beginners and basic IoT tasks

### **Popular Arduino Boards:**

* Arduino Uno
* Arduino Mega
* Arduino Nano

### **What Arduino is good at:**

* Real-time control
* Low-level hardware interactions
* Simple automation projects
* Sensor-based systems

**Examples:**
Smart lights, temperature monitoring, basic robots.

# **2. Raspberry Pi**

Raspberry Pi is a **small single-board computer** — far more powerful than Arduino.

### **Key points you MUST write:**

* Runs a full operating system (Raspberry Pi OS/Linux)
* Uses a microprocessor (Broadcom ARM-based)
* Supports Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, HDMI, USB, camera
* Used for complex IoT applications requiring computation, internet, or multimedia
* Programs can be written in any language (Python is most popular)

### **Popular Raspberry Pi Models:**

* Raspberry Pi 4
* Raspberry Pi Zero
* Raspberry Pi 3

### **What Raspberry Pi is good at:**

* Web servers
* Image processing
* Data analytics
* Cloud connectivity
* High-level IoT applications

**Examples:**
Home automation hub, surveillance camera system, local IoT server.

# **3. Key Differences (MUST LEARN TABLE)**

This table alone can get you 5–7 marks.

| **Feature**  | **Arduino**                | **Raspberry Pi**                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Type         | Microcontroller            | Single-board computer                     |
| OS           | No OS                      | Runs full OS (Linux)                      |
| Programming  | C/C++ (Arduino IDE)        | Python, C, Java, Node.js, etc.            |
| Power        | Very low power             | Higher power consumption                  |
| Connectivity | External modules needed    | Built-in Wi-Fi/Bluetooth (new models)     |
| Use Case     | Real-time control, sensors | Heavy computation, networking, multimedia |
| Cost         | Cheaper                    | More expensive                            |

Remember:
**Arduino = Control + Real-time**
**Raspberry Pi = Compute + Networking**

# **4. How They Work Together in IoT**

Some IoT systems use both:

* **Arduino** handles sensors + actuators
* **Raspberry Pi** handles cloud, API, local server

This combination is common in:

* Smart home systems
* Industrial sensors + gateways
* School/college IoT labs

If you mention this in exams, it shows deeper understanding.

---

# **Exam-Ready Short Answer**

If asked:

**“Explain IoT Hardware Platforms.”**

Write:

* Arduino → microcontroller, real-time control, simple tasks
* Raspberry Pi → microprocessor, full OS, advanced tasks
* Add differences table

That’s a complete, high-scoring answer.
