* room occupancy
* temperature
* time schedules

Reduces power consumption in homes and offices.

---

## **(vi) Renewable Energy Monitoring**

IoT in solar/wind systems:

* track energy production
* detect faults
* monitor battery levels

Helps optimize clean energy sources.

---

## **(vii) Energy Usage Analytics**

Cloud platforms analyze usage patterns:

* peak usage time
* waste points
* suggestions to reduce consumption

Very useful for industries and smart buildings.
