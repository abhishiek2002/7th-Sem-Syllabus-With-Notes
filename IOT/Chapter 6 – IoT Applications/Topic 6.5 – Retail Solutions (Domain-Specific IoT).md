# **3. Major Applications of IoT in Retail**

These points are what you must write in the exam.

---

## **(i) Smart Inventory Management**

IoT sensors automatically track:

* stock level
* product movement
* expiry dates

Reduces human effort and eliminates manual stock checking.

---

## **(ii) Smart Shelves**

Shelves detect:

* low-stock items
* misplaced products
* item removal

Useful in supermarkets and pharmacies.

---

## **(iii) Automated Checkout (Cashier-less Stores)**

Examples:

* Amazon Go
* Smart retail kiosks

Customer picks items → sensors detect items → bill generated automatically → payment via app.

---

## **(iv) Personalized Customer Experience**

Beacons detect customer presence and send offers to their smartphones.

Useful in:

* malls
* hypermarkets
* branded stores

---

## **(v) Supply Chain Tracking**

IoT enables real-time tracking of products from warehouse → transport → store.

Sensors help monitor:

* temperature
* humidity
* location

Useful for food, medicine, and sensitive goods.

---

## **(vi) Smart Pricing (Electronic Shelf Labels)**

Prices can be updated instantly through a central system.

Benefits:

* no manual label changes
* dynamic pricing during sales or high demand

---

## **(vii) Loss Prevention & Security**

IoT cameras + sensors detect:

* shoplifting
* unauthorized exits
* suspicious activity

Improves store security.

---

## **(viii) Customer Behavior Analytics**

IoT cameras track:

* footfall
* popular aisles
* customer movements

Retailers optimize store layout based on insights.
