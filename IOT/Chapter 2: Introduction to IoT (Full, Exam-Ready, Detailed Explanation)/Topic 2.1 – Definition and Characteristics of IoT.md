# **Topic 2.1 – Definition and Characteristics of IoT**

## **1. Definition of IoT (Write this exact style in exam)**

> **The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical devices embedded with sensors, actuators, processors, and communication capabilities, enabling them to collect data, exchange information, and perform actions without direct human involvement.**

This is tight, accurate, and includes the required keywords:

* sensors
* actuators
* processors
* communication
* collect data
* exchange information
* automation

You won’t lose marks with this.

## **2. Characteristics of IoT**

These are the “core qualities” that make a system an IoT system.
Most students list random features — don’t do that. Stick to these **six**, and you’ll write a perfect answer.

### **(i) Connectivity**

Devices must be connected to each other or the internet using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, LoRa, cellular, etc.
No connectivity → no IoT.

### **(ii) Sensing**

Sensors collect raw data from the environment.
This is the “input” of IoT — temperature, motion, humidity, gas levels, etc.

### **(iii) Intelligence**

Devices can process data and make decisions—either locally (on device/gateway) or with cloud help.
Even minimal automation counts as intelligence.

### **(iv) Dynamic Nature**

Devices can join, leave, and change states in the network anytime.
The system adapts automatically.

### **(v) Scalability**

IoT systems must support from 10 devices to millions of devices.
This is critical for industrial IoT and smart city deployments.

### **(vi) Heterogeneity**

Different devices (hardware/software), different protocols, and different data formats must work together.

# **Exam-Ready Short Answer Version (6–8 marks)**

If the question is:

**“Explain the characteristics of IoT.”**

Write:

* Connectivity
* Sensing
* Intelligence
* Dynamic Nature
* Scalability
* Heterogeneity

Then give 1–2 lines each. You’re done.
