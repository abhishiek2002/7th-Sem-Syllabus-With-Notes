Alright, moving to **Topic 2.3 – IoT Enabling Technologies**.
This topic is straightforward, but examiners love asking short notes from it.
Let’s keep it tight, clear, and scoring.

# **Topic 2.3 – IoT Enabling Technologies**

These are the technologies that make IoT systems possible.
Without these, IoT wouldn’t work.
You’ll typically get questions like:

* “Explain enabling technologies of IoT.”
* “Write short notes on WSN / Cloud / Big Data / Embedded Systems.”

Here’s the complete, exam-ready breakdown.

---

# **1. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)**

WSN = a network of many small, low-power sensor nodes that communicate wirelessly.

### **Key points:**

* Each node can sense, process, and send data.
* Works in distributed environments.
* Ideal for large-scale sensing: forests, agriculture fields, factories, cities.

### **Why it enables IoT:**

IoT needs widespread sensing. WSN provides that infrastructure.

# **2. Cloud Computing**

IoT produces massive data. Devices alone cannot store or process it.
Cloud solves this.

### **Cloud enables:**

* Remote access from anywhere
* Large-scale storage
* Powerful computing for analytics
* Real-time dashboards
* Integration with ML/AI

### **Why it enables IoT:**

Without cloud, IoT would be limited to small, local systems.

---

# **3. Big Data Analytics**

IoT continuously generates high-volume data streams.
Big Data technologies analyze this data to extract insights.

### **Big Data helps in:**

* Detecting patterns
* Forecasting trends
* Anomaly detection
* Predictive maintenance in industries
* Improving decision-making

### **Why it enables IoT:**

IoT devices → huge data → Big Data analytics → actionable results.

---

# **4. Embedded Systems**

Every IoT device is basically an embedded system.

### **Embedded system =**

Microcontroller/microprocessor + sensors + actuators + software + communication interface.

Examples:

* Arduino
* ESP8266 / ESP32
* Raspberry Pi
* STM32 boards

### **Why it enables IoT:**

They provide:

* low cost
* small size
* low power consumption
* real-time operation

Exactly what IoT devices need.

# **Exam Short Notes**

If you get:
**“Write a note on IoT enabling technologies.”**

Your exact bullet points should be:

* Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)
* Cloud Computing
* Big Data Analytics
* Embedded Systems

Give 3–4 lines each. Done.
