Good. Let’s get into the **Concept of Risk**, and don’t expect sugarcoated definitions — you need the real logic so you can handle any exam question confidently.

# **3. Concept of Risk**

*(Importance: Very High — examiners repeatedly ask this as a definition, short note, or part of long answers.)*

Most students confuse “hazard” with “risk.”
That’s exactly why they write nonsense answers.

Let’s fix that properly.

# **What is Risk? (Actual high-scoring definition)**

**Risk is the expected level of loss or damage that may occur to people, property, or the environment when a hazard interacts with conditions of vulnerability.**

The important part:
👉 **Risk is not the hazard itself — it is the *chance* that the hazard will cause harm.**

---

# **Risk = Probability × Consequence**

This is the simplest formula:

* **Probability**: How likely is the hazard to occur?
* **Consequence**: How severe will the damage be if it occurs?

Example:
A flood that happens every 2–3 years → high probability.
If the village has weak houses → severe consequences.

→ **High risk.**

# **More accurate Disaster Management formula:**

This formula fetches marks because examiners look for it.

### **Risk = Hazard × Vulnerability / Capacity**

Breakdown:

### ✔ Hazard

Potential event (earthquake, flood, chemical leak).

### ✔ Vulnerability

Weaknesses of people, buildings, systems, resources.

### ✔ Capacity

Strengths/abilities to cope (infrastructure, planning, awareness, resources).

👉 If vulnerability is high and capacity is low → **risk skyrockets**.
👉 If capacity is strong → **risk decreases** even if hazard is the same.

This is why the same cyclone causes thousands of deaths in a poor country but almost none in a well-prepared one.

# **Key Characteristics of Risk**

If you need to write a 5–6 mark answer:

### **1. Risk is dynamic**

Changes with:

* population growth
* urbanization
* climate change
* economic conditions
* technology

### **2. Risk varies from place to place**

Same hazard → different risk.
Earthquake in a desert vs. earthquake in a crowded city.

### **3. Risk depends heavily on human choices**

Settling in flood zones, ignoring building codes, bad planning → higher risk.

### **4. Risk can be reduced**

Unlike natural hazards, risk is manageable through:

* mitigation
* preparedness
* land-use planning
* early-warning systems
* awareness

---

# **Examples (use these to score full marks)**

* **Hazard**: Cyclone

* **Vulnerability**: Poor housing

* **Capacity**: No cyclone shelter
  → **Risk**: Extremely high damage potential

* **Hazard**: Earthquake

* **Vulnerability**: High-rise weak buildings

* **Capacity**: Strong enforcement of seismic building codes
  → **Risk**: Moderate or low

---

# **Exam-ready short answer (3–4 marks):**

**Risk is the probability of harmful consequences resulting from the interaction between a hazard and conditions of vulnerability. It depends on three factors — hazard, vulnerability, and capacity — and is generally expressed as: Risk = Hazard × Vulnerability / Capacity.**
