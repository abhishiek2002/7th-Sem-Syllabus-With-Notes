Alright, moving to a **high-weight, high-confusion** topic. Students usually dump random examples and lose marks. You’re going to write a clean, structured, examiner-proof answer.

# **6. Hazards & Vulnerabilities**

*(Importance: Extremely High — guaranteed short notes + long-answer component.)*

This topic has two parts:

1. **Hazards** – natural + man-made
2. **Vulnerability** – what makes people/systems weak

We’ll cover the first sub-topic now:

---

# **A. Natural & Man-made Hazards**

First, understand:

### **A hazard is NOT a disaster.**

A hazard only becomes a disaster when it hits vulnerable people with low coping capacity.
Most students confuse this. Don’t.

Hazard = *potential threat*
Disaster = *actual damage*

---

# **1. Natural Hazards**

These hazards arise from **natural processes** of the Earth. No human involvement in their origin.

### **Categories & Examples:**

---

## **a) Geological Hazards**

Related to Earth’s crust.

* Earthquakes
* Volcanic eruptions
* Tsunami
* Landslides
* Soil liquefaction
* Sinkholes

These cause huge structural damage.

---

## **b) Hydrological Hazards**

Related to water bodies.

* Floods
* Flash floods
* Coastal erosion
* Riverbank erosion

---

## **c) Meteorological Hazards**

Weather and atmosphere.

* Cyclones
* Hurricanes / Typhoons
* Lightning
* Thunderstorms
* Tornadoes
* Hailstorms

---

## **d) Climatological Hazards**

Long-duration climate-related processes.

* Drought
* Heatwaves
* Cold waves
* Wildfires (when caused by extreme dryness)

---

## **e) Biological Hazards**

Caused by living organisms.

* Epidemics (Dengue, COVID-19)
* Pest attacks (locust swarms)
* Plant/animal diseases

---

# **2. Man-made (Anthropogenic) Hazards**

These result from human activities, negligence, technology failure, or industrial processes.

Categories:

---

## **a) Industrial Hazards**

* Chemical leaks
* Gas explosions
* Boiler blasts
* Industrial fires
* Toxic waste release
  **Example:** Bhopal Gas Disaster (1984)

---

## **b) Nuclear/Radiological Hazards**

* Nuclear reactor accidents
* Radiation leaks
  **Examples:** Fukushima (2011), Chernobyl (1986)

---

## **c) Environmental Hazards**

* Deforestation
* Soil erosion due to mining
* Pollution (air, water, soil)
* Oil spills

---

## **d) Fire Hazards**

* Urban fires
* Market fires
* Factory fires
* Electrical short circuits

---

## **e) Transport Hazards**

* Road accidents
* Rail accidents
* Aviation accidents
* Ship collisions

---

## **f) Warfare & Terrorism Hazards**

* Bomb blasts
* Biological/chemical weapons
* Cyber-attacks (in advanced contexts)

---

# **Exam Tip (Important):**

Whenever a question says *"List or explain natural and man-made hazards,"*
don’t just list examples.
Add category + example — that’s how you score full marks.

---

# **Exam-Ready Answer (4–6 marks)**

**Natural hazards** arise from natural processes such as geological, hydrological, meteorological, climatological, and biological events. Examples: earthquakes, floods, cyclones, droughts, epidemics.
**Man-made hazards** result from human activities like industrial accidents, nuclear failures, fires, pollution, transport accidents, and terrorism. Examples: gas leaks, oil spills, building collapses, radiological leaks.

If you’re ready, we’ll continue with the next sub-topic:

### **Response time, frequency, forewarning levels of hazards**
