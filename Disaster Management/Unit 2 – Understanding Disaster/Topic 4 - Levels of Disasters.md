# **4. Levels of Disasters**

*(Importance: High — examiners ask this a lot because it's part of India’s official disaster classification.)*

If you write this section weakly, you're throwing marks.

This topic basically explains **how disasters are categorized based on the severity, required response, and administrative capacity needed.**

In India, disasters are generally understood at **three operational levels**:

---

# **1. *Local Level Disaster***

### **Meaning:**

A small-scale event that **local authorities can handle** using their own resources.

### **Examples:**

* Localized fire
* Small building collapse
* Minor flood in one village
* Road accident with limited casualties

### **Who handles it:**

* Municipal corporation
* Panchayat
* Local police
* Local health facilities
* Local fire services

### **Key point to write:**

No external help from district/state needed.

---

# **2. *District Level Disaster***

### **Meaning:**

Disaster where **local bodies fail**, and the district administration must take charge.

### **Examples:**

* Flood affecting multiple blocks
* Major industrial accident
* Large transportation accident
* Urban fire affecting several localities

### **Who handles it:**

* District Collector / District Magistrate
* DDMA (District Disaster Management Authority)
* District police force
* Local NGOs, civil society

### **Key point:**

District resources are enough — **state intervention is not necessary** unless the situation escalates.

---

# **3. *State Level Disaster***

### **Meaning:**

Damage is beyond district capacity, so **state government intervention** is required.

### **Examples:**

* Cyclones affecting multiple districts
* Large-scale floods
* Major drought
* Epidemics/outbreaks
* Earthquake affecting multiple districts

### **Who handles it:**

* State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA)
* State relief commissioner
* State-level police, health, fire, PWD, military support if needed

### **Key point:**

The state allocates funds, personnel, and planning support.

---

# **4. *National Level Disaster***

This is crucial — don’t mix it with "state level."

### **Meaning:**

The disaster is so massive that **state resources are insufficient**, and central government intervention becomes mandatory.

### **Examples:**

* 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami
* 2013 Uttarakhand disaster
* 2020 COVID-19 nationwide pandemic
* Severe cyclones like Fani or Hudhud
* Major earthquakes (Bhuj 2001)

### **Who handles it:**

* NDMA (National Disaster Management Authority)
* NDRF (National Disaster Response Force)
* Armed forces
* Central ministries
* National & international aid organizations

### **Key point:**

National disaster is declared when coordinated multi-state/national-level response is required.

# **Alternate Classification Often Asked in Exams**

If your college uses the older framework, sometimes they expect:

### **Level 1 Disaster**

Managed locally without external help.

### **Level 2 Disaster**

State government assistance required.

### **Level 3 Disaster**

Central government assistance required.

**Write both systems if the question seems ambiguous.**

---

# **Exam-Ready Short Answer (3–4 marks)**

**Disasters are classified into levels based on the required response capacity:**

* **Local Level:** Managed by local bodies using their resources.
* **District Level:** District administration takes charge when local capacity fails.
* **State Level:** State government intervention needed when district resources are insufficient.
* **National Level:** Central government, NDRF, armed forces involved when the disaster overwhelms state capacity.
