Good — now we’re in **Unit 2**, the most heavily weighted part of the syllabus.
This topic shows up in **long answers**, **short notes**, and even **MCQs**. So we’re not doing any shallow explanation here.

# **1. Concept of Disaster**

*(Importance: Very High — core theory; examiners *love* asking this.)*

If your concept is weak here, everything else collapses. So let’s define it properly and logically.

---

# **A disaster is NOT just “a big accident.”**

Most students mess this up.
A disaster only becomes a disaster when **local capacity fails**.

That’s the keyword examiners look for.

---

# **Precise, High-Scoring Definition**

A **disaster** is a *serious disruption* of normal life caused by natural or man-made events, resulting in widespread damage to life, property, or environment, **which exceeds the ability of the affected community to cope using its own resources.**

This last part — *exceeds local capacity* — is what separates a disaster from a regular hazard.

---

# **Breakdown of the Concept (This is where you score marks)**

## **1. It is a serious disruption**

Not a small incident. It disrupts normal functioning of society:

* transportation
* communication
* healthcare
* safety
* economy

If normal systems × fail → disaster.

---

## **2. It causes widespread damage**

The impact includes:

* human lives
* property
* infrastructure
* environment
* essential services
* livelihoods

The damage must be **significant**.

---

## **3. It overwhelms local capacity**

If local police, hospitals, or fire services can handle it → NOT a disaster.
If they can’t → it becomes a disaster requiring external help (state, national, military, NGOs).

This is the core classification criterion.

---

## **4. It may be sudden or slow-onset**

Examiners include this in tricky questions.

**Sudden-onset**:

* earthquakes
* cyclones
* explosions

**Slow-onset**:

* droughts
* epidemics
* environmental degradation

Both are disasters if they cause serious disruption.

---

## **5. It may be natural or man-made**

Two major categories:

* **Natural**: flood, cyclone, earthquake, tsunami
* **Man-made**: industrial accident, radiological leak, fire, terrorism

---

## **6. Disasters are the result of hazard + vulnerability**

A hazard alone is not a disaster.
You need **people + exposure + vulnerability** for a disaster to occur.

Formula examiners like:

> **Disaster = Hazard × Vulnerability / Capacity**

If vulnerability is high and capacity is low → disaster becomes severe.

---

# **Why this concept matters?**

Because every other topic (risk, mitigation, preparedness, types of disasters, DM cycle) is built on this foundation.
If you understand this clearly, long-answer questions become easy.

---

# **Short Exam Answer (3–4 marks)**

**A disaster is a serious disruption that causes widespread damage to life, property, and environment, exceeding the capacity of the affected community to cope using its own resources.**
It may be natural or man-made, sudden or slow-onset, and results from the interaction of hazards and vulnerability.
Examples include earthquakes, floods, cyclones, industrial accidents, and epidemics.
