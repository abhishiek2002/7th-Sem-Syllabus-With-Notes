# **3. Expected Course Outcomes**

*(Importance: Low–Medium, but very likely to appear as a 2–3 marker or short note. Just write clean, precise points.)*

This topic is basically:
**“What will a student be able to do after studying this Disaster Management course?”**

Don’t write buzzwords — write actual capability-based outcomes.

---

## **1. Ability to Understand Disaster Concepts Clearly**

Students should be able to define disasters, differentiate types (natural vs man-made), and explain how disasters evolve and impact society.

---

## **2. Ability to Identify Hazards & Assess Risks**

You should be able to analyze an area, identify hazards, evaluate vulnerability, and predict risk levels logically instead of guessing.

---

## **3. Skills in Planning Mitigation and Preparedness**

You should gain the competence to design basic plans for:

* mitigation
* preparedness
* community safety
* early warning
* evacuation

This is a key outcome because it connects theory with real application.

---

## **4. Understanding National & State Disaster Management Systems**

Students should know the structure and roles of:

* NDMA
* SDMA
* DDMA
* NDRF
* Local authorities

And understand how the Disaster Management Act guides disaster governance.

---

## **5. Ability to Participate in Disaster Response**

You’re expected to understand how coordination, communication, and quick decision-making work during emergencies.

You won’t become an NDRF commando — but you gain theoretical and procedural clarity.

---

## **6. Capability to Apply Scientific Tools & Technology**

Outcome includes using or understanding tools like:

* GIS and hazard maps
* early-warning systems
* weather forecasting
* safety protocols for industrial hazards

This prepares students for modern disaster management scenarios.

---

## **7. Improved Community Awareness & Safety Culture**

The course expects you to act as someone who can spread awareness about safety, disaster prevention, and risk reduction in your community.

---

## **8. Ability to Analyze Real Disaster Case Studies**

Students should be able to:

* break down past disasters
* identify what went wrong
* evaluate response effectiveness
* suggest improvement measures

This shows higher-order understanding — exactly what examiners want.

---
