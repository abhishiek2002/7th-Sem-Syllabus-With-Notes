# **2. Scope of Disaster Management**

*(Importance: Low–Medium, but examiners sometimes twist short questions from here. Don’t skip it.)*

The “scope” simply means **what areas disaster management covers** — the full range of activities, responsibilities, and domains involved before, during, and after a disaster.

Most students write vague nonsense here. Don’t do that. Write specific, structured points.
