Alright, let’s cut the fluff and get straight to work.
We’ll start **topic-by-topic**, **one topic at a time**, **no spoon-feeding**, no “feel-good” nonsense — just clear, crisp, exam-oriented content with enough depth to actually score marks.

# **1. Objectives of the Course (Disaster Management)**

*(Importance: Low–Medium, but examiners expect at least a clean definition + 5–6 solid points.)*

I’ll give you exactly what you need: clear points, proper logic, and enough substance to fill a 6–8 mark answer if needed.

## **Objective of Disaster Management Course**

The **core purpose** of this course is simple:
*To make students capable of understanding how disasters occur, how they impact society, and how to reduce their effects through systematic planning, preparedness, response, and recovery.*

Now the detailed objectives:

### **1. Build Conceptual Clarity About Disasters**

You should understand what a disaster actually is — not newspapers’ drama versions — but the technical definition: an event causing **serious disruption** requiring **external help** beyond local capacity.

### **2. Learn the Factors That Make Disasters Dangerous**

Disasters don’t become deadly on their own. Human vulnerability, poor planning, exposure, and lack of preparedness amplify the damage.
The objective is to understand these risk-multiplying factors.

### **3. Understand Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)**

This course trains you to think in terms of **preventing disasters**, not just reacting to them.
You need to learn how planning, mitigation, and policies reduce disaster impacts.

### **4. Develop Skills for Preparedness and Response**

Students should be able to analyze situations, plan evacuation, manage resources, coordinate relief, and understand how emergency systems work.

### **5. Understand National & State Disaster Policies and Mechanisms**

Real exam questions come from here.
You’re expected to know the **Disaster Management Act**, roles of NDMA, SDMA, DDMA, and institutions like NDRF.

### **6. Promote Community Awareness & Safety Culture**

The idea is to train students to spread awareness about hazards, prevention, and safety norms so communities can reduce risks on their own.

### **7. Learn Tech & Scientific Tools for Disaster Assessment**

GIS, early-warning systems, hazard mapping, weather forecasting — these tools matter.
The objective is to understand how science + technology reduces disaster impact.

### **8. Encourage Responsible Citizenship During Disasters**

No heroism, no chaos.
The objective is to promote organized, informed, and lawful behaviour during emergencies, ensuring cooperation with authorities.
