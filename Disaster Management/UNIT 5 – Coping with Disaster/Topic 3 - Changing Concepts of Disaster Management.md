Alright, moving ahead. This topic is short but **very commonly asked** as a 3–6 mark conceptual question.
Most students give vague, outdated points — and that’s exactly where they lose marks.

You’re going to write a tight, modern, examiner-ready answer.

# **3. Changing Concepts of Disaster Management**

*(Importance: Medium — but appears frequently)*

Disaster Management (DM) used to be very narrow — mostly *relief after the disaster*.
Over the years, the approach has **completely changed**.

You must show this shift clearly.

---

# **A. Old Concept (Traditional Approach)**

Earlier, DM was seen as:

### **1. Relief-Centered**

Focus only after disaster:

* food
* water
* shelter
* rescue

### **2. Government-Dependent**

Communities waited for government help.

### **3. Crisis-Response Only**

Preparedness, mitigation, prevention were ignored.

### **4. No long-term planning**

Disasters were treated as one-time events.

### **5. Minimal coordination**

Departments worked independently.

This old model FAILED because it only reacted — it never prevented.

---

# **B. New Concept (Modern Approach)**

Modern disaster management is **scientific, preventive, community-based, and continuous**.

Here are the key shifts:

---

## **1. From Relief → Risk Reduction**

Old thinking: “Help after disaster.”
New thinking: **“Reduce risk before disaster.”**

This shift is the heart of modern DM.

---

## **2. From Response → Mitigation & Preparedness**

Modern DM focuses more on:

* hazard mapping
* early warning
* building codes
* environmental protection
* preparedness training

You PREPARE and PREVENT, not panic.

---

## **3. From Government Alone → Community Participation**

Communities are now central:

* community volunteers
* local disaster committees
* local evacuation planning
* capacity building

A community that is trained saves more lives than any external force.

---

## **4. From Single-Agency → Multi-Agency Coordination**

Modern DM requires:

* NDMA
* SDMA
* DDMA
* Police
* Fire
* Health
* Army
* NGOs
* Local bodies

Disaster management is now a **system**, not a department.

---

## **5. From Narrow → All-Hazard Approach**

Earlier: focus on just floods or earthquakes.
Now: **all hazards**, including:

* industrial disasters
* epidemics
* chemical hazards
* nuclear hazards
* climate-change-induced events

The system must handle all threats.

---

## **6. From Manual → Technology-Driven**

Modern DM uses:

* GIS
* remote sensing
* weather radars
* satellite imaging
* mobile alerts
* drones
* AI forecasting

Technology improves accuracy and speed.

---

## **7. From Temporary Shelters → Build Back Better**

Recovery is now about:

* stronger houses
* better roads
* safer schools
* improved drainage
* sustainable development

Don’t rebuild the old vulnerability — rebuild stronger.

---

## **8. From Local Issues → Global Perspective**

Disasters now include:

* global pandemics (COVID-19)
* climate change
* transboundary hazards

DM is a global discipline, not just local.

---

# **C. Summary of the Shift**

Write this line in the exam — it’s high scoring:

**“The concept of disaster management has shifted from reactive relief-based actions to proactive risk reduction, preparedness, mitigation, community participation, and technology-driven approaches.”**

---

# **D. Exam-Ready Short Answer (4–6 marks)**

**The concept of disaster management has evolved from a relief-centered, government-dependent, response-based approach to a proactive and holistic system focused on risk reduction, mitigation, preparedness, community involvement, institutional coordination, and the use of modern technology. Modern disaster management emphasizes early warning systems, building codes, environmental protection, multi-agency cooperation, and the principle of ‘Build Back Better’ to ensure long-term resilience.**
