Alright, moving ahead. This topic looks “simple” but most students have **zero idea** what to write, so they lose marks.
You’ll write it clearly and score easily.

# **2. Alternative Adjustment Processes**

*(Importance: Medium — asked as a conceptual 3–5 mark question)*

---

# **A. What Does This Mean? (Clear Definition)**

**Alternative adjustment processes are the different ways people, families, and communities modify their behavior, lifestyle, and living conditions to cope with disaster impacts and adapt to new realities.**

In simple terms:
👉 They are **changes people make** to survive and continue life after a disaster.

These adjustments can be:

* temporary
* permanent
* economic
* social
* environmental

And they happen because **normal routines become impossible**.

---

# **B. Why Are Alternative Adjustment Processes Needed?**

Because disasters disrupt:

* homes
* jobs
* transport
* health
* safety
* environment
* food supply

People have no choice but to adapt.

---

# **C. Types of Alternative Adjustment Processes (Scoring Section)**

Write at least 5–6 of these for a full answer.

---

## **1. Temporary Relocation**

People shift to safer areas for days or months.

### Example:

* Flood victims staying in school shelters
* Cyclone-affected families staying in community centers

---

## **2. Permanent Relocation or Resettlement**

If the original area becomes unsafe.

### Example:

* Moving villages away from riverbanks
* Relocation after landslides or coastal erosion

Sometimes forced, sometimes voluntary.

---

## **3. Change of Livelihood / Occupation**

If the main source of income is damaged.

### Example:

* Farmers shifting to wage labor after drought
* Fishermen working in construction after cyclones
* Small shop owners changing trade due to losses

---

## **4. Modifying Housing Structure**

People rebuild homes with safer materials or design changes.

### Example:

* Using flood-resistant plinth elevation
* Reinforcing roofs after cyclones
* Earthquake-safe construction

This is a long-term adjustment.

---

## **5. Changing Consumption Patterns**

People adapt due to scarcity of resources.

### Examples:

* Reducing food consumption
* Using alternative fuel sources
* Prioritizing essential items

Not ideal, but common in disasters.

---

## **6. Social Adjustments**

Changes in social behaviour or routines.

### Example:

* Community sharing of water and food
* Joint childcare in shelters
* Relying more on extended family or neighbors

Social cohesion becomes survival strategy.

---

## **7. Psychological Adjustment**

Mental adaptation to trauma and stress.

### Examples:

* Seeking counselling
* Community prayer/meetings for emotional support
* Adjusting expectations about recovery timeline

Mental coping is as important as physical coping.

---

## **8. Migration (Short-term or long-term)**

People temporarily or permanently move to search for work or safety.

### Example:

* Post-disaster migration to cities
* Seasonal migration after crop failure

Very common after repeated disasters.

---

## **9. Adoption of New Survival Strategies**

People develop new methods to handle future risks.

### Example:

* Storing more food/water
* Keeping emergency kits
* Avoiding risky locations
* Reinforcing houses

This becomes part of long-term resilience.

---

# **D. Characteristics of Adjustment Processes**

Examiners sometimes ask this indirectly.

* They are **adaptive**, not fixed
* Mostly based on available resources
* May be **short-term or long-term**
* Can be **positive (safe)** or **negative (risky)**
* Often influenced by poverty, education, and community support

---

# **E. Example to Use in Answers**

Cyclone-affected coastal family:

* Moves temporarily to cyclone shelter
* Shifts livelihood from fishing to daily wage labor
* Repairs house with stronger roof
* Reduces expenses
* Participates in community rebuilding groups

Realistic examples = higher score.

---

# **F. Exam-Ready Short Answer (4–5 marks)**

**Alternative adjustment processes are the modifications in behavior, living conditions, and livelihood strategies adopted by individuals and communities to survive and recover after a disaster. These include temporary or permanent relocation, changing occupations, modifying houses, altering consumption patterns, relying on community support, psychological coping, migration, and adopting new survival methods. These adjustments help people adapt to the changed environment and rebuild life under new constraints.**
