It creates NDRF and SDRF, mandates national, state, and district disaster management plans, and establishes response and mitigation funds. The Act shifts focus from relief to prevention, preparedness, and mitigation. The National Policy on Disaster Management (2009) builds on the Act by promoting a holistic, multi-hazard, technology-based and community-centered approach. It emphasizes mainstreaming disaster risk reduction into development planning, strengthening institutional mechanisms, capacity building, early warning systems, and environmental protection. Together, the Act and Policy provide a strong legal and strategic framework for effective disaster management in India.**
