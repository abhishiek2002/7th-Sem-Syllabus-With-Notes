Alright, moving ahead.
This topic is **extremely common** in exams because it tests whether you understand how disaster planning works at ground level.
Most students write vague plans with no structure — you won’t.

Let’s do it clean, systematic, and scoring.

# **5. State & District Disaster Management Plans**

*(Importance: Very High — 6–8 mark question)*

The DM Act, 2005 makes it **mandatory** for every state and district to prepare a disaster management plan.

You need to show:

* What the plan contains
* How it is prepared
* Who prepares it
* Why it matters

Let’s break it down.

---

# **A. State Disaster Management Plan (SDMP)**

Prepared by the **State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA)** and approved by the State Government.

---

## **A1. Objectives of SDMP**

* Reduce disaster risk at state level
* Strengthen preparedness & mitigation
* Ensure coordination among departments
* Provide guidelines for district plans
* Protect life, property, and environment

---

# **A2. Contents of the State DM Plan**

Write these in the exam. They fetch full marks.

---

## **1. State Disaster Profile**

* Map of hazards
* Disaster history
* Climate profile
* Vulnerable zones (floodplains, seismic zones, coastal areas)

---

## **2. Risk and Vulnerability Assessment**

Assessment includes:

* physical vulnerability
* social vulnerability
* economic vulnerability
* environmental vulnerability
* capacity analysis

---

## **3. Mitigation Strategies**

Long-term measures:

* enforcing building codes
* infrastructure strengthening
* flood control measures
* landslide prevention
* fire safety
* industrial safety guidelines
* coastal zone management

---

## **4. Preparedness Measures**

Short-term readiness:

* early warning system
* communication arrangements
* mock drills
* public awareness programs
* training of officials & volunteers
* school safety days

---

## **5. Response Plan**

Details who does what during a disaster:

* roles of police, fire, SDRF, health department
* evacuation procedures
* search and rescue teams
* logistics and relief supply routes
* medical response plan

---

## **6. Resource Inventory (State Level)**

A list of:

* equipment
* shelters
* hospitals
* vehicles
* fire stations
* warehouses
* helipads

This supports fast response.

---

## **7. Coordination Mechanism**

Coordination between:

* SDMA
* SEC
* DDMA
* District Collectors
* NGOs
* NDRF

---

## **8. Financial Arrangements**

Covers:

* SDRF (State Disaster Response Fund)
* state budget allocations
* insurance mechanisms
* contingency funds

---

## **9. Procedures for Rehabilitation & Recovery**

Long-term recovery plan:

* rebuilding infrastructure
* restoring livelihoods
* compensation
* housing reconstruction

---

## **10. Monitoring & Updating**

Plan must be updated every year.

---

# **B. District Disaster Management Plan (DDMP)**

Prepared by the **District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA)** headed by the **District Collector/Magistrate**.

This is the **actual operational plan** used during disasters.

---

## **B1. Objectives of DDMP**

* Provide district-specific disaster strategy
* Ensure coordination of all departments
* Identify local hazards and vulnerable groups
* Guide evacuation and relief
* Strengthen community-based preparedness

---

# **B2. Contents of the District DM Plan**

---

## **1. District Hazard Profile**

Covers:

* flood-prone villages
* cyclone paths
* industrial hazard zones
* earthquake risk areas
* fire-prone markets
* epidemic-prone communities

---

## **2. Vulnerability Mapping**

Maps vulnerable:

* slums
* low-lying areas
* old buildings
* disabled persons
* elderly population
* schools and hospitals

This is **very important** for planning.

---

## **3. Resource Map (District Level)**

Includes:

* shelters
* hospitals and PHCs
* boats
* buses, trucks
* JCB machines for debris clearance
* generators
* stockpiles of food & medicine

This is needed for quick deployment.

---

## **4. Departmental Roles & Responsibilities**

Each department gets specific duties:

* Police → security & evacuation
* Fire → firefighting & rescue
* Health → medical teams
* PWD → road clearance
* Irrigation → flood monitoring
* Education → school safety
* Animal husbandry → livestock care

---

## **5. Early Warning and Communication Plan**

Includes:

* flow of information from IMD → SDMA → DDMA → communities
* emergency communication network
* sirens, SMS alerts, radio

---

## **6. Evacuation & Shelter Management Plan**

* evacuation routes
* transport arrangements
* shelter locations
* water, sanitation, food planning
* special care for disabled, elderly, children

---

## **7. Response Mechanism**

Covers:

* search and rescue teams
* first-aid units
* emergency operation center (EOC)
* rapid damage assessment teams
* volunteer coordination

This is the most active part of the DDMP.

---

## **8. Relief Distribution Plan**

* food/water distribution points
* medical supply delivery
* sanitation arrangements
* camp hygiene
* prevention of epidemics

---

## **9. Recovery & Rehabilitation Plan**

Post-disaster actions:

* rebuilding damaged houses
* repairing roads & bridges
* restoring electricity & water supply
* repairing schools & hospitals
* livelihood rehabilitation

---

## **10. Updating & Mock Drills**

DDMP must be revised **annually**, with mandatory mock drills.

---

# **C. Exam-Ready Short Answer (6–8 marks)**

**State Disaster Management Plans (SDMP) are prepared by the SDMA and include the state’s hazard profile, vulnerability assessment, mitigation strategies, preparedness measures, response framework, resource inventory, coordination mechanisms, and financial provisions. District Disaster Management Plans (DDMP), prepared by the District Magistrate-led DDMA, focus on local hazards, vulnerable areas, resource mapping, evacuation routes, departmental responsibilities, early warning systems, search and rescue, relief distribution, and rehabilitation procedures. Together, they ensure systematic disaster preparedness, response, and recovery at state and district levels.**
