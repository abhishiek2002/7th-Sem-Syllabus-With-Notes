Alright, moving forward. This topic is basically the **practical procedure** behind disaster planning.
Most students write generic lines like “identify hazards, make plans” — that won’t score.
You need **clear, step-by-step logic** the examiner can’t ignore.

Let’s do it properly.

# **2. Steps for Formulating Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Plans**

*(Importance: Very High — examiners love 6–8 mark questions on this)*

A DRR plan is the **blueprint** that reduces future disaster losses.
Your answer must show a **systematic flow**, not random bullet points.

---

# **Step 1: Hazard Identification**

Know exactly what hazards threaten the area.

* flood
* cyclone
* earthquake
* industrial hazard
* drought
* fire
* epidemic

This forms the base of all planning.

---

# **Step 2: Vulnerability & Capacity Assessment**

Identify:

### **Vulnerability:**

* weak buildings
* poor communities
* unplanned urban areas
* fragile environment

### **Capacity:**

* rescue teams
* shelters
* hospitals
* trained volunteers
* equipment

You can’t reduce risk if you don’t know strengths and weaknesses.

---

# **Step 3: Risk Analysis & Prioritization**

Combine hazard + vulnerability + exposure.

Rank risks as:

* **Very High**
* **High**
* **Moderate**
* **Low**

Only then do you know where to focus first.

---

# **Step 4: Set DRR Objectives**

Write clear goals such as:

* reduce flood impact
* ensure earthquake-safe construction
* strengthen early warning
* reduce deaths and injuries
* protect livelihoods

Objectives guide the entire plan.

---

# **Step 5: Identify Mitigation Measures (Long-Term)**

Mitigation reduces the impact of hazards.

Examples:

* earthquake-resistant buildings
* flood embankments
* cyclone shelters
* drainage improvement
* enforcement of building codes
* slope stabilization

This step focuses on *pre-disaster* safety.

---

# **Step 6: Develop Preparedness Measures (Short-Term)**

Preparedness ensures readiness.

Includes:

* mock drills
* evacuation plans
* public awareness
* community training
* emergency kits
* communication plans
* early warning systems

This step reduces panic and confusion.

---

# **Step 7: Resource Mapping & Inventory Creation**

List all available resources:

* shelter locations
* medical facilities
* rescue equipment
* vehicles
* trained personnel
* warehouses
* communication tools

Without knowing available resources, planning is useless.

---

# **Step 8: Assign Roles & Responsibilities**

Clear responsibilities avoid delays.

Assign to:

* DDMA
* police
* fire services
* health department
* public works
* NGOs
* community groups

Everyone must know **exactly** what to do.

---

# **Step 9: Create Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**

SOPs act as action guides.

SOPs include:

* how to activate warnings
* how to evacuate
* how to conduct search & rescue
* how to run shelters
* how to distribute relief
* how to coordinate agencies

Good SOPs = better coordination.

---

# **Step 10: Develop Communication & Coordination Plan**

Plan must include:

* who communicates what
* backup systems
* wireless networks
* satellite phones
* information flow structure

Communication failure = disaster chaos.

---

# **Step 11: Prepare an Implementation Timeline**

Plans must be actionable.

Timeline includes:

* short-term (0–6 months)
* medium-term (6–24 months)
* long-term (2–5 years)

This avoids endless delays.

---

# **Step 12: Monitoring, Evaluation & Updating the Plan**

Disaster plans must evolve with time.

Includes:

* periodic review
* mock drill assessment
* post-disaster lessons
* updating maps, records, contacts

A plan that is not updated becomes useless.

---

# **Exam-Ready Short Answer (6–8 marks)**

**The steps for formulating Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) plans include identifying hazards, assessing vulnerabilities and capacities, conducting risk analysis, setting clear objectives, identifying mitigation and preparedness measures, mapping resources, assigning responsibilities, developing SOPs, planning communication systems, creating implementation timelines, and regularly monitoring and updating the plan. These steps ensure systematic and effective risk reduction and enhance community resilience.**
