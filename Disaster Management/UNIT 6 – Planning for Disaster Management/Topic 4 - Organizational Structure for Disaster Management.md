Alright, moving forward.
This topic is **pure scoring** because it’s straightforward: “Who does what at which level?”
Most students mix up the structure — so they lose marks.
You’ll keep it clean, hierarchical, and examiner-friendly.

# **E. Diagram for Full Marks**

Draw this simple hierarchy in your exam:

```
          NATIONAL LEVEL
  PM → NDMA → NEC → NDRF
           ↓
          STATE LEVEL
     CM → SDMA → SEC → SDRF
           ↓
        DISTRICT LEVEL
 DM/Collector → DDMA
           ↓
     LOCAL/COMMUNITY LEVEL
 Panchayats / Municipalities / NGOs / Community Groups
```

This diagram alone boosts your score immediately.

# **F. Exam-Ready Short Answer (6–8 marks)**

**India’s disaster management organizational structure is defined by the DM Act, 2005 and operates at four levels. At the national level, NDMA (headed by the Prime Minister) lays policies and guidelines, supported by NEC and NDRF. At the state level, SDMA (headed by the Chief Minister) prepares state plans and coordinates preparedness through the SEC and SDRF. At the district level, DDMA (headed by the District Magistrate) prepares district plans and coordinates local response. At the local level, municipalities, panchayats, NGOs, and community groups manage evacuation, awareness, and immediate relief. This multi-tier system ensures coordinated and effective disaster management across India.**
