Alright, moving into **Unit 3 – Hazard Assessment & Disaster Management Mechanism**.
This section is **heavy, conceptual, and repeatedly asked** in long answers.
We’ll handle it cleanly — one topic at a time — without fluff.

# **1. Vulnerability Factors & Dimensions**

*(Importance: High — examiners ask this as short notes, long answers, and MCQs.)*

Most students think “vulnerability” just means “weakness.”
That’s wrong and incomplete.

You need a crisp concept + proper categories + real examples.

Let’s break it down properly.

---

# **A. What is Vulnerability? (Real definition)**

**Vulnerability is the degree to which people, infrastructure, or systems are likely to be harmed by a hazard due to their physical, social, economic, or environmental weaknesses.**

Hazard alone doesn’t kill — **vulnerability decides the damage**.

---

# **B. Major Vulnerability Factors (the “why”)**

These are the reasons people become vulnerable.

### **1. Poverty**

* Poor housing
* No savings
* No access to healthcare
* No ability to evacuate
  Biggest vulnerability factor in developing countries.

---

### **2. Unsafe Living Conditions**

* Settling on riverbanks → floods
* Living on slopes → landslides
* Coastal huts → cyclones
* Slums near factories → industrial accidents

Location = vulnerability multiplier.

---

### **3. Poorly Built Infrastructure**

* Non-engineered buildings
* Weak bridges
* Faulty wiring (fire hazard)
* Illegal constructions

This is why earthquakes collapse entire towns.

---

### **4. Lack of Awareness / Education**

* No idea how to evacuate
* No knowledge of warning signs
* Panic behaviour
* Ignoring safety laws

People without awareness die first.

---

### **5. High Population Density**

* Faster spread of epidemics
* Higher casualties in earthquakes
* More people exposed to hazards

Example: Urban slums.

---

### **6. Poor Governance**

* Corruption
* Weak building code enforcement
* No evacuation planning
* No monitoring systems

Governance quality directly decides disaster severity.

---

### **7. Environmental Degradation**

* Deforestation → floods, landslides
* Mining → erosion
* Pollution → health vulnerability

Humans create their own risk.

---

### **8. Climate Change**

Increasing vulnerability by intensifying:

* cyclones
* heatwaves
* floods
* droughts

This is becoming a major exam trend.

---

# **C. Dimensions of Vulnerability (the “types”)**

This is extremely important.
Examiner expects these 4–5 categories, not random points.

---

## **1. Physical Vulnerability**

**Meaning:** Weakness related to physical structures, location, and built environment.

**Examples:**

* Weak buildings collapsing in earthquakes
* Houses near rivers flooding easily
* Poor drainage causing urban floods

---

## **2. Social Vulnerability**

**Meaning:** Vulnerability caused by social factors.

**Includes:**

* Age (children, elderly)
* Disability
* Gender inequality
* Education level
* Social exclusion
* Cultural beliefs

Example: Elderly people dying more during heatwaves.

---

## **3. Economic Vulnerability**

**Meaning:** Financial weakness increasing risk.

**Examples:**

* Low-income households unable to rebuild
* No insurance
* Loss of livelihood after disaster
* Farmers hit by drought

Poor families take longer to recover.

---

## **4. Environmental Vulnerability**

**Meaning:** Environmental degradation increasing hazard impact.

**Examples:**

* Deforestation → landslides
* Wetland destruction → floods
* Soil erosion → drought risk

Nature itself becomes fragile.

---

## **5. Institutional/Political Vulnerability**

**Meaning:** Weak systems, governance, and disaster planning.

**Examples:**

* No warning systems
* Corruption
* Poor enforcement of building codes
* Slow government response

Weak institutions = high disaster loss.

---

# **D. Exam-Ready Combined Answer (5–8 marks)**

**Vulnerability refers to the degree of loss a community or system may suffer due to its internal weaknesses when exposed to a hazard. Major vulnerability factors include poverty, unsafe settlements, poor infrastructure, lack of awareness, high population density, environmental degradation, and poor governance. Vulnerability has multiple dimensions: physical (structural weakness), social (age, gender, education), economic (income and livelihood insecurity), environmental (ecosystem degradation), and institutional (weak planning and governance). These factors collectively determine how severely a hazard can turn into a disaster.**
