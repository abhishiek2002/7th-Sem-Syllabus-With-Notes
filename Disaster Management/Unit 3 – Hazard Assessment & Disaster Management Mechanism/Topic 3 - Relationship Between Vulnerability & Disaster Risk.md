Alright, moving to the next concept — and this one is **simple but extremely important**.
Examiners love asking it in 4–6 mark questions because most students write vague statements.

You’re going to write a clean, logical answer.

# **3. Relationship Between Vulnerability & Disaster Risk**

*(Importance: High — core theory + repeated exam question)*

If you understand this section properly, you can easily connect hazard, vulnerability, capacity, and risk in any long answer.

---

# **A. First, the Formula You Must Know**

This is the backbone of the entire concept:

# **Disaster Risk = Hazard × Vulnerability / Capacity**

Hazard alone **cannot** create a disaster.
Vulnerability is the multiplier.
Capacity is the reducer.

This formula alone can fetch you 2–3 marks.

# **B. The Core Relationship (Explain this clearly)**

### **1. Higher Vulnerability = Higher Disaster Risk**

When a community has weaknesses like:

* poor housing
* poverty
* no awareness
* weak infrastructure
* lack of governance

…even a small hazard leads to huge damage.

Example:
A 6.5 earthquake kills thousands in a poor city but very few in a well-prepared country.
Why? Vulnerability difference.

---

### **2. Lower Vulnerability = Lower Disaster Risk**

If people have:

* strong houses
* good health services
* disaster education
* safe construction practices

…risk drops dramatically even when hazards remain the same.

Example:
Japan experiences strong earthquakes regularly but casualties are minimal.

---

### **3. Vulnerability Converts a Hazard Into a Disaster**

Hazard → potential
Vulnerability → trigger
Capacity → defender

If vulnerability is high and capacity is low → disaster happens.

---

# **C. Types of Vulnerability That Increase Risk**

Mention these for a 6-mark answer:

* **Physical vulnerability**: weak buildings → collapse risk
* **Social vulnerability**: elderly, children, uneducated → higher casualties
* **Economic vulnerability**: poor recovery, no insurance
* **Environmental vulnerability**: deforestation → floods, landslides
* **Institutional vulnerability**: bad governance, no warning systems

All increase disaster risk directly.

---

# **D. Examples (Use these for full marks)**

### **Example 1: Floods**

* Poor drainage + slums near rivers → high vulnerability
  → Even moderate rain becomes a flood disaster.

### **Example 2: Earthquakes**

* Illegal constructions + weak foundations
  → Small quake causes huge losses.

### **Example 3: Cyclones**

* No cyclone shelters + weak huts
  → High casualties even with early warnings.

### **Example 4: Heatwaves**

* Elderly population + outdoor workers
  → Higher mortality risk.

# **E. How to Present in Exam (Perfect 5–6 mark answer)**

**The relationship between vulnerability and disaster risk is direct. Vulnerability refers to the weaknesses of people, infrastructure, economy, and environment, and higher vulnerability leads to higher disaster risk. A hazard becomes a disaster only when it affects vulnerable populations. Vulnerability multiplies the impact of hazards, while capacity reduces it. The formula “Risk = Hazard × Vulnerability / Capacity” explains this relationship. Physical, social, economic, environmental, and institutional vulnerabilities all contribute to increasing disaster risk. Therefore, reducing vulnerability is the key to reducing disaster risk.**
