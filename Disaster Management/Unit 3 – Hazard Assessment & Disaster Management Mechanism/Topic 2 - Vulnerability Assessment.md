Alright, straight to the next topic — no fluff.

# **2. Vulnerability Assessment**

*(Importance: High — this is a core concept in Unit 3 and examiners love asking it as a 4–8 mark question.)*

Most students write definitions without explaining **how** assessment is done.
You’re going to write a structured, logic-driven answer.

# **A. What is Vulnerability Assessment? (Precise definition)**

**Vulnerability assessment is the systematic process of identifying, measuring, and analyzing the weaknesses of people, infrastructure, economy, and environment that make them more likely to be harmed by a hazard.**

In simple terms:
👉 It tells you **who** is at risk, **why**, and **how much**.

---

# **B. Why Is Vulnerability Assessment Important? (Exam points)**

* Helps identify vulnerable groups
* Helps prioritize disaster-prone areas
* Helps allocate resources efficiently
* Essential for planning mitigation and preparedness
* Reduces future disaster losses
* Helps in decision-making and policy creation

This is the foundation of **disaster risk reduction (DRR)**.

---

# **C. Key Components of Vulnerability Assessment**

Examiners expect these 4–5 components:

---

## **1. Hazard Exposure Identification**

Identify what hazards a community is exposed to:

* flood zone
* seismic zone
* drought-prone area
* cyclone-prone coast

Exposure = the starting point.

---

## **2. Assessment of Physical Vulnerability**

Look at structural weaknesses.

Examples:

* non-engineered buildings
* fragile roads & bridges
* poor drainage
* unsafe slopes
* settlements near rivers

---

## **3. Assessment of Social Vulnerability**

Identify groups with higher risk.

Examples:

* elderly
* children
* people with disabilities
* uneducated population
* socially marginalized groups

---

## **4. Assessment of Economic Vulnerability**

Check how financially capable the community is.

Metrics:

* income levels
* livelihood dependence
* savings
* insurance coverage
* employment type (daily wage vs salaried)

Poorer communities → slower recovery.

---

## **5. Assessment of Environmental Vulnerability**

Study ecosystem sensitivity.

Examples:

* deforestation
* soil erosion
* degraded wetlands
* polluted water bodies
  These increase hazard impact.

---

## **6. Assessment of Institutional/Administrative Vulnerability**

Check the strength of local systems.

Look at:

* governance quality
* building code enforcement
* early warning systems
* disaster plans
* emergency services availability

Weak institutions → high vulnerability.

---

# **D. Steps of Vulnerability Assessment (This fetches full marks)**

The process can be presented in clear steps:

---

### **Step 1: Identify hazards**

Understand what hazards affect the region.

---

### **Step 2: Map exposure**

Who and what is in danger?

* population
* buildings
* critical infrastructure
* livelihoods

---

### **Step 3: Analyze vulnerabilities**

Assess using dimensions:

* physical
* social
* economic
* environmental
* institutional

---

### **Step 4: Evaluate capacities**

What strengths exist?

* resources
* training
* community knowledge
* rescue facilities
* early warning systems

---

### **Step 5: Rank vulnerability levels**

Classify areas/groups into:

* high
* medium
* low vulnerability

---

### **Step 6: Recommend mitigation measures**

Final step = what action must be taken to reduce vulnerability.

---

# **E. Example (Use in exam for extra marks)**

Flood-prone district:

* **High physical vulnerability:** Houses near rivers, weak embankments
* **High social vulnerability:** Elderly population in low-lying areas
* **High economic vulnerability:** Farmers dependent on monsoon
* **High environmental vulnerability:** Deforested riverbanks
* **Low capacity:** No early warning system

→ High total vulnerability.

---

# **F. Exam-Ready Short Answer (5–6 marks)**

**Vulnerability assessment is a systematic process of identifying and analyzing the weaknesses of communities, infrastructure, and systems that increase disaster risk. It includes assessment of physical, social, economic, environmental, and institutional vulnerabilities. The process involves hazard identification, exposure mapping, vulnerability analysis, capacity evaluation, ranking of vulnerable areas, and recommending mitigation measures. This assessment helps in effective disaster planning, resource allocation, and risk reduction.**
