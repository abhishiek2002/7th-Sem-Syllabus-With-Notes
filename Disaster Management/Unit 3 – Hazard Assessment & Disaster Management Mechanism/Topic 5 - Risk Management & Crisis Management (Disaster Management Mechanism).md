Alright, shifting into the **Disaster Management Mechanism** section — the part where examiners expect clarity, not stories.
This topic is **high-yield**, so pay attention.

# **17. Risk Management & Crisis Management Concepts**

*(Importance: High — frequently asked as short notes or as part of long answers.)*

Most students mix these two.
They are NOT the same.
You must show the **difference** clearly — that’s where the marks are.

Let’s break it down without nonsense.

---

# **A. What is Risk Management?**

**Risk Management = Reducing the possibility and impact of disasters *before* they occur.**

It focuses on **planning, prevention, preparedness, and mitigation.**

### **Core idea:**

Stop the disaster from becoming a disaster.

Risk management is **proactive**.

---

## **Key Components of Risk Management**

### **1. Risk Identification**

Figure out what hazards exist:

* floods
* earthquakes
* industrial accidents
* drought

---

### **2. Risk Analysis**

Understand how serious each risk is.
Look at:

* hazard frequency
* vulnerability
* exposure
* impact potential

---

### **3. Risk Evaluation**

Rank risks as:

* high
* medium
* low

Helps decide priorities.

---

### **4. Risk Reduction Measures (Mitigation)**

Actions taken to reduce impact:

* flood embankments
* seismic-resistant buildings
* cyclone shelters
* land-use planning
* environmental protection

---

### **5. Preparedness**

Training and planning for emergencies:

* early warning systems
* evacuation routes
* mock drills
* stockpiling relief supplies

Preparedness belongs **under risk management**, not crisis management.

---

# **B. What is Crisis Management?**

**Crisis Management = Actions taken *during and immediately after* a disaster to reduce loss of life and damage.**

It focuses on **response, rescue, relief, and immediate recovery.**

Crisis management is **reactive**.

---

## **Key Components of Crisis Management**

### **1. Early Warning Communication**

Deliver warnings through:

* SMS alerts
* sirens
* media
* local announcements

---

### **2. Evacuation & Emergency Response**

* moving people to safe areas
* search and rescue
* fire response
* first aid
* law and order management

---

### **3. Relief Operations**

* food, water, medicine distribution
* temporary shelters
* restoring electricity
* reconnecting transport routes

---

### **4. Temporary Recovery Efforts**

* clearing debris
* repairing roads
* restoring basic services
* assessing damage

Recovery becomes long-term later, but crisis management handles the initial phase.

# **C. Risk Management vs. Crisis Management (Clear Differences)**

| **Risk Management**            | **Crisis Management**                               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Before disaster                | During & after disaster                             |
| Focus: Prevention & mitigation | Focus: Rescue, relief, recovery                     |
| Proactive                      | Reactive                                            |
| Reduce hazard impact           | Reduce casualties & losses                          |
| Includes planning, training    | Includes evacuation, triage, emergency coordination |
| Long-term strategic measure    | Short-term emergency actions                        |

If the exam asks **“differentiate”**, this table gives full marks.

# **D. Examples to Use in Answers**

### **Risk Management Example:**

Constructing cyclone shelters on the Odisha coast → reduces future cyclone casualties.

### **Crisis Management Example:**

NDRF rescuing people after the Kerala floods → action taken during the disaster.

This contrast is EXACTLY what examiners want.

---

# **E. Exam-Ready Short Answer (4–6 marks)**

**Risk management is the proactive process of identifying, analyzing, and reducing disaster risks through mitigation and preparedness measures. Crisis management is the reactive process of handling emergencies during and immediately after disasters through warning, evacuation, rescue, relief, and short-term recovery. Risk management prevents disasters; crisis management deals with them when they occur.**
