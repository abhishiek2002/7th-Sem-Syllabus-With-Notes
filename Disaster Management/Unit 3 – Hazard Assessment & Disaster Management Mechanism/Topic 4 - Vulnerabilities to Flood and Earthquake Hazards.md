Alright, let’s keep the momentum. This topic is **straightforward but heavily tested**. Most students write generic lines like “flood is dangerous” or “earthquake can collapse buildings” — that’s useless.
You need **vulnerability-specific** points — exactly what examiners want.

*(Importance: High — guaranteed short notes or 6-mark question)*

You’re not explaining the hazard here;
you’re explaining **who becomes vulnerable and why.**

Let’s break it into **two clean sections**.

---

# **A. Vulnerabilities to Flood Hazards**

Flood vulnerability = weaknesses that make people/areas suffer more damage when floods occur.

---

## **1. Physical Vulnerability**

* Settlements in low-lying areas
* Houses built near rivers / drains
* Poor drainage systems
* Weak embankments / broken river banks
* Kutcha (mud) houses easily washed away
* Roads made with poor materials → quick erosion
* Urbanization without storm-water planning → waterlogging

Floods don’t kill randomly — they target weak structures.

---

## **2. Social Vulnerability**

* Children, elderly, pregnant women
* Low literacy → no awareness on warning signals
* People with disabilities unable to evacuate
* High population density in urban slums
* Communities unaware of evacuation routes
* Cultural resistance (people refusing to evacuate livestock)

Social limitations magnify casualties.

---

## **3. Economic Vulnerability**

* Farmers dependent on monsoon → total livelihood loss
* Poor families living in riverbank slums
* No insurance → slower recovery
* Loss of daily-wage work
* Inability to rebuild homes quickly

The poorer the community, the greater the flood damage.

---

## **4. Environmental Vulnerability**

* Deforestation in catchment areas → increased runoff
* Encroached wetlands → loss of natural water storage
* Siltation of rivers reducing water-carrying capacity
* Climate change → heavier rainfall patterns
* Soil erosion worsening flood impact

Environment shapes how severe floods get.

---

## **5. Institutional Vulnerability**

* No early warning systems
* Corruption in drainage construction
* Poor river management
* No emergency shelters
* Weak disaster readiness by local authorities

Weak institutions = major flood disasters.

---

# **B. Vulnerabilities to Earthquake Hazards**

Earthquake vulnerability = weaknesses that increase damage from seismic activity.

Earthquakes don’t kill people — **buildings kill people**.
Remember that logic.

---

## **1. Physical Vulnerability**

* Non-engineered buildings (most dangerous factor)
* Old structures with no seismic design
* Buildings made with poor materials
* Houses on soft soil (liquefaction risk)
* High-rise buildings without reinforcement
* Encroachments and congested older city areas
* Bridges, flyovers, schools without retrofitting

Physical vulnerability = primary cause of earthquake deaths.

---

## **2. Social Vulnerability**

* High population density → more casualties
* Lack of awareness (“run outside,” “panic,” etc.)
* Elderly, disabled, and children
* People living in unsafe slums
* Panic behaviour leading to stampedes

Social factors worsen the impact massively.

---

## **3. Economic Vulnerability**

* Poor households cannot afford strong construction
* No earthquake insurance
* Inability to retrofit buildings
* People depending on physical shops → loss of business
* Migrant labour living in unsafe structures

Economic fragility = slow recovery after the disaster.

---

## **4. Environmental Vulnerability**

* Unstable slopes → landslides after quakes
* Riverbank settlements → soil liquefaction
* Mining areas → weakened geological structure
* Fault-line encroachment → more destruction

Environment plays a big role in how violently the land responds.

---

## **5. Institutional Vulnerability**

* Poor enforcement of building codes (India’s biggest problem)
* Corrupt construction approvals
* No earthquake preparedness drills
* Slow emergency response
* Lack of trained search-and-rescue teams
* Missing seismic monitoring stations

Poor governance → high casualties even in moderate quakes.

---

# **C. Exam-Ready Answer (6–8 marks)**

**Flood vulnerability arises from physical weaknesses such as low-lying settlements, poor drainage, and weak housing; social factors like elderly population, low literacy, and high density; economic weakness including poverty and lack of insurance; environmental degradation like deforestation and wetland encroachment; and institutional failure such as poor warning systems. Earthquake vulnerability includes non-engineered buildings, soft soil, old and congested settlements, lack of awareness, poverty-driven unsafe construction, unstable slopes, and weak enforcement of seismic building codes. Higher vulnerability directly leads to higher disaster risk in both cases.**
