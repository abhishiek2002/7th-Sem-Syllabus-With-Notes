Alright, straight to the next topic — this one is **easy marks** if written properly.
Most students only give examples; you need to give **meaning + examples + purpose**.

Let’s do it cleanly.

# **2. Structural & Non-Structural Measures**

*(Importance: Medium–High — appears as short notes, definitions, or 4–6 mark questions.)*

These two terms are core to mitigation and capacity building.

---

# **A. Structural Measures**

**Structural measures are physical constructions or engineering interventions designed to reduce the impact of hazards.**

In simple words:
👉 Anything **you build** to protect people and property is a structural measure.

These involve:

* construction
* strengthening
* modification of buildings
* protective structures

---

## **Examples of Structural Measures (Write 6–8 to score full marks)**

### **1. Embankments & Dams**

To control floods.

### **2. Cyclone Shelters**

Designed to withstand high wind speeds.

### **3. Earthquake-Resistant Buildings**

Reinforced concrete, base isolation.

### **4. Retaining Walls / Slope Protection**

For preventing landslides.

### **5. Sea Walls / Coastal Barriers**

To counter storm surge and coastal erosion.

### **6. Flood Drainage Systems**

Urban drainage, channel widening.

### **7. Fire-Safety Infrastructure**

Sprinklers, fire hydrants, fire-resistant materials.

### **8. Stormwater Harvesting Structures**

To reduce urban flooding.

---

# **Purpose of Structural Measures**

* Reduce physical damage
* Prevent collapse
* Control hazard impact
* Strengthen community safety
* Long-term protection

Structural measures require **money, engineering, and long-term planning**.

---

# **B. Non-Structural Measures**

**Non-structural measures are policies, plans, laws, awareness, and practices that reduce vulnerability without using physical construction.**

Simply:
👉 Anything you **do, regulate, teach, or plan**, not build.

These involve:

* planning
* capacity building
* regulations
* communication
* education

---

## **Examples of Non-Structural Measures**

### **1. Building Codes & Safety Laws**

Mandatory seismic codes, fire-safety guidelines.

### **2. Land-Use Planning**

Avoiding construction on floodplains, coastal zones, unstable slopes.

### **3. Early Warning Systems**

Weather alerts, cyclone warnings, flood forecasts.

### **4. Public Awareness & Education**

Mock drills, posters, training, community meetings.

### **5. Emergency Plans & SOPs**

State, district, and institutional disaster plans.

### **6. Insurance Schemes**

Crop insurance, property insurance.

### **7. Environmental Protection Laws**

Afforestation, wetland conservation.

### **8. Evacuation Planning**

Identifying safe routes and shelters.

# **Purpose of Non-Structural Measures**

* Change behaviour
* Improve preparedness
* Reduce exposure
* Ensure safe development
* Strengthen governance
* Cheaper and faster than structural measures

These measures are **policy-driven** and improve resilience without construction.

# **C. Structural vs Non-Structural Measures (Exam Table)**

| **Structural Measures**  | **Non-Structural Measures**        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Physical constructions   | Policy, planning, awareness        |
| Reduce physical impact   | Reduce vulnerability & exposure    |
| Expensive                | Low-cost                           |
| Long implementation time | Quick to implement                 |
| Engineering-based        | Governance & education-based       |
| Examples: shelters, dams | Examples: building codes, warnings |

This table is perfect for a “differentiate” question.

# **D. Exam-Ready Short Answer (4–6 marks)**

**Structural measures are engineering constructions such as embankments, cyclone shelters, earthquake-resistant buildings, retaining walls, and drainage systems that physically protect communities from hazards. Non-structural measures include policies and practices such as building codes, land-use planning, early warning systems, awareness programs, insurance, and disaster management plans. Together, these measures reduce vulnerability and strengthen disaster preparedness.**
