Alright, let’s finish the last topic of **Unit 4 – Capacity Building**.
This one shows up in many papers as:

* **“Write short note on legislative support for disaster management.”**
* **“Explain state and national level legal framework for disaster management.”**
* **“Role of DM Act in capacity building.”**

Most students only mention “DM Act 2005” and stop — that’s a guaranteed low score.
You need a **clear, structured explanation** of BOTH national and state legislative support.

# **6. Legislative Support (State & National)**

*(Importance: Medium–High — must be written clearly and precisely)*

Legislative support = **laws, policies, guidelines, and frameworks** that make disaster management systematic and enforceable.

Let’s break it down.

---

# **A. National-Level Legislative Support**

India’s disaster governance changed massively after the 2004 tsunami.

### **1. Disaster Management Act, 2005 (Core law)**

This is the backbone of disaster management in India.

### **Key provisions:**

* Disaster management is legally structured.
* Defines roles for national, state, and district authorities.
* Makes disaster planning mandatory.
* Assigns responsibilities for preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery.
* Enables funds for disaster management.

---

## **2. National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)**

Created under DM Act 2005.

### **Functions:**

* Makes national policies
* Lays guidelines for states
* Coordinates with ministries and agencies
* Approves national disaster plans
* Runs awareness campaigns
* Oversees NDRF

NDMA's guidelines are *legally binding* for all states.

---

## **3. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)**

Also created under the DM Act.

* Specialized search & rescue force
* Trained for floods, earthquakes, cyclones, chemical/nuclear hazards
* World-class equipment
* Quick deployment

NDRF is one of the most important elements of legislative capacity building.

---

## **4. National Executive Committee (NEC)**

Supports NDMA administratively.

### **Functions:**

* Prepares National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP)
* Coordinates implementation of laws and guidelines

---

## **5. National Policies**

* National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP)
* National Policy on Disaster Management (2009)
* National Guidelines for Cyclones, Drought, Earthquakes, Floods, etc.

These ensure *uniform standards* across India.

---

## **6. Financial Provisions**

DM Act mandates:

* National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF)
* National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF)
  Funds are legally approved for rescue, relief, and mitigation.

---

# **B. State-Level Legislative Support**

Each state has its own structure under DM Act 2005.

---

## **1. State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA)**

Chaired by the **Chief Minister**.

### **Functions:**

* Create state disaster management plan
* Enforce building codes
* Formulate state policies
* Coordinate district-level responses
* Conduct training and capacity building
* Ensure early warning distribution

---

## **2. State Executive Committee (SEC)**

Headed by the **Chief Secretary**.

### **Functions:**

* Implements SDMA policies
* Coordinates with departments like health, police, PWD, irrigation
* Supervises district authorities

---

## **3. District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA)**

Chaired by the **District Magistrate/Collector**.

### **Functions:**

* Prepare district disaster management plan
* Maintain shelters
* Manage flood, cyclone, and earthquake response
* Coordinate local agencies and volunteers
* Conduct awareness programs
* Handle emergency communication

DDMA is where **real action happens**.

---

## **4. State Disaster Response Force (SDRF)**

State-level force for early response.

---

## **5. State-Specific Disaster Laws (varies by states)**

Many states have their own additional rules:

* Building by-laws
* Coastal zone regulations
* Fire safety acts
* Land-use restrictions
* Pollution and industrial safety laws

These laws reduce vulnerability.

---

# **C. Why Legislative Support is Needed (Exam Points)**

You must write at least 4–5 points:

* Ensures systematic disaster management
* Defines authority and responsibility
* Enforces building codes & safety norms
* Makes disaster plans mandatory
* Ensures funds for relief & mitigation
* Improves coordination between agencies
* Reduces corruption & confusion
* Strengthens long-term capacity

Legislation turns disaster management from optional → compulsory.

---

# **D. Exam-Ready Short Answer (5–6 marks)**

**Legislative support for disaster management in India is provided mainly by the Disaster Management Act, 2005. At the national level, the Act establishes NDMA, NDRF, NEC, national plans, guidelines, and financial mechanisms like NDRF and NDMF. At the state level, the Act mandates SDMA, SEC, DDMA, and SDRF to create and implement state and district disaster plans, enforce building codes, coordinate departments, and strengthen preparedness. These legal frameworks ensure systematic, coordinated, and effective disaster management across the country.**
