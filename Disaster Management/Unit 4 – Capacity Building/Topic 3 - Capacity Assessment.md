Alright, let's keep going. This topic is short, straightforward, and highly scoring — **perfect for a 3–5 mark question**.
Most students confuse “capacity assessment” with “vulnerability assessment.”
You’re going to write it cleanly and correctly.

# **3. Capacity Assessment**

*(Importance: Medium–High — common short note)*

---

# **A. What is Capacity Assessment? (Precise Definition)**

**Capacity assessment is the process of identifying and evaluating the strengths, resources, skills, institutions, and systems available in a community to effectively prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters.**

In simple words:
👉 Capacity assessment = *finding what a community CAN do*
instead of what it CAN’T.

It is the opposite lens of vulnerability assessment.

# **B. Why Capacity Assessment Matters**

Write these points in the exam:

1. Helps understand existing strengths
2. Improves disaster planning
3. Reduces dependency on external help
4. Helps use local resources efficiently
5. Strengthens resilience
6. Helps decide where investments are needed
7. Helps identify skilled human resources
8. Supports faster response and recovery

# **C. Types of Capacities (Very important)**

Capacity is not just equipment; it includes people, institutions, skills, and systems.

Here are the key categories:

---

## **1. Physical Capacity**

Facilities and equipment:

* Hospitals
* Ambulances
* Fire stations
* Cyclone shelters
* Boats for flood rescue
* Storage warehouses
* Communication tools
* Rescue tools (ropes, cutters, PPE kits)

**Physical capacity = things you can use physically.**

---

## **2. Human Capacity**

People and their skills:

* trained volunteers
* medical teams
* NDRF/SDRF personnel
* engineers & technicians
* teachers, leaders, community groups

Includes knowledge, training, experience.

---

## **3. Social Capacity**

Community bonds & networks:

* mutual aid groups
* local committees
* social support systems
* strong communication between people

Communities with unity recover faster.

---

## **4. Institutional Capacity**

Strength of systems and administration:

* NDMA, SDMA, DDMA
* government departments
* local government bodies
* NGOs
* emergency operation centers
* early warning systems
* policies, laws, SOPs

Strong institutions = stronger disaster resilience.

---

## **5. Economic Capacity**

Financial strength:

* government disaster funds (NDRF/SDRF)
* personal savings
* insurance coverage
* local business stability
* access to credit

Richer communities rebuild faster.

---

## **6. Environmental Capacity**

Healthy natural systems that reduce hazard impact:

* mangroves (cyclone protection)
* wetlands (flood control)
* forests (landslide prevention)

Environment is a natural protector.

---

# **D. Steps of Capacity Assessment (Use this for long answers)**

This is where you score extra.

### **1. Identify hazard-specific needs**

What type of disaster the region faces?

### **2. List available resources**

Rescue teams, shelters, hospitals, volunteers, equipment.

### **3. Evaluate effectiveness**

Are resources modern? Enough? Accessible?

### **4. Identify gaps**

Where is training needed? What equipment is missing?

### **5. Recommend improvements**

Training, budgeting, better coordination, new infrastructure.

---

# **E. Example to Use in Answers (Simple but effective)**

Cyclone-prone region capacity assessment:

* Cyclone shelters → available
* Trained volunteers → available
* Early warning → strong
* Boats → adequate
* Medical teams → need improvement
* Financial support → limited

This instantly shows understanding.

---

# **F. Exam-Ready Short Answer (4–5 marks)**

**Capacity assessment is the process of identifying and evaluating the strengths and resources of a community that help in disaster prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. It includes assessing physical, human, social, economic, environmental, and institutional capacities. Capacity assessment identifies existing strengths, reveals gaps, and supports planning for effective disaster management and improved resilience.**
